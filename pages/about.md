# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br><br>
I am a sophomore studying <i>Computer Science</i> at University of Western Ontario. My interest is in the field of game design, blockchain, and computer vision. I am currently a computer vision developer at <a href="https://github.com/WesternAI" target="_blank">Western AI</a> here <a href="https://club-spotlight.ca/western-ai/" target="_blank">Western AI</a>.
<br><br>
I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou" target="_blank">Zheng Zhou</a>, then came abroad to study in Canada since grade 7.
<br><br>
I love logic and critical thinking. I achieved provincial champion for the Olympiads Math Competition back in elementary school. I have a passion for rowing, music and gaming. I look forward for the future of AI.
